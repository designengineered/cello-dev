<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	My name is Cello. I am a designer by day, and developer by night.
	Although my background revolves around the intersection between
	storytelling, design, and systems of management. Lately, I spend my days
	coming up with ways to automate tedious but important tasks, as well as
	the documentation around them.
</p>
<p>
	I am passionate about technology, visual storytelling, animal rights and
	most recently privacy. These interests drive my design and development
	process. I'm currently looking to expand into a more backend-centric
	position. I am willing to learn anything that will help me get the job
	done and achieve my goals.
